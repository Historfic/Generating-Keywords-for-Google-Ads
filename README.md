### Project Description
When structuring a search engine marketing account, a key task is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages.

In this project, I'll practice how to automatically generate keywords for a search engine marketing campaign using Python to send website visitors to the right landing page.


### Project Scenario
I am working for a digital marketing agency that has been approached by a massive online furniture retailer. They want to test my skills at creating large campaigns for their entire website. I have been tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. The client wants me to generate keywords for the following products:
- Sofas
- Convertible Sofas
- Love Seats
- Recliners
- Sofa Beds

The client is a low-cost retailer, offering many promotions and discounts, so I will need to focus on keywords that reflect this. Additionally, I need to avoid luxury keywords and topics, as the target audience consists of price-sensitive customers. Given the tight budget, it's important to focus on a tightly targeted set of keywords and ensure they are all set to exact and phrase match.
